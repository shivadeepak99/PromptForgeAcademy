## Explainer

Ethical prompting is about designing prompts that respect human values, fairness, and safety. Since LLMs influence decision-making, prompts must avoid harmful stereotypes, unsafe advice, or manipulative outputs.

Practices include:
- **Disclaimers**: Clearly state limitations (e.g., “This is not medical advice”).
- **Bias reduction**: Rewrite prompts to avoid stereotypes.
- **User safety**: Frame prompts so that dangerous or harmful responses are not elicited.

Ethical prompting ensures AI applications are responsible and aligned with societal norms.
