## Explainer

API orchestration is the practice of coordinating multiple external APIs within a single workflow to accomplish complex tasks. Instead of relying on one tool, the model can integrate data from several APIs — for example, combining weather data with a calendar to schedule events.

This strategy demonstrates how LLMs can act as control hubs, intelligently sequencing API calls and integrating outputs into coherent responses. API orchestration is critical for building real-world AI applications and SaaS products.

## Examples — Copy & Run

```text
# Example 1: Route planning
Combine a maps API and a traffic API to suggest the fastest route to the airport.

# Example 2: Market outlook
Use a stock API and a news API to summarize today’s market outlook.

# Example 3: Event planning
Use weather + calendar APIs to plan an outdoor event. Output must include location, time, and weather forecast.
```

## Lab — Guided Practice

**Objective:** Learn to chain multiple API calls within a single workflow.

1. Open **OraclePlayground** with preset `lab-5-api`.
2. Run the event planning example.
3. Observe how multiple APIs are integrated.
4. Modify the scenario (e.g., travel planning, financial reports) and re-run.

**Completion Criteria:** Model successfully orchestrates at least two APIs to solve a task.

## Mini-Quest — Applied Challenge

**Task:** Create a prompt that uses both a translation API and a text-to-speech API to translate “Hello, how are you?” into Japanese and then output it as audio-ready text.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Model orchestrates at least two APIs.
- Output includes translated text and audio instruction.
- Workflow is coherent and practical.

## Quiz — Knowledge Check

1. **True / False:** API orchestration refers to coordinating multiple APIs in a single workflow. → **True**
2. **MCQ:** Which of the following best describes API orchestration in LLM workflows? → “Chaining multiple API calls for a task.”
