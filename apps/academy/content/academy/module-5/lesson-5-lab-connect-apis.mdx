<LessonHeader title="Lab: Connect PromptForge with APIs" xp={140} duration={35} belt="Brown" />

## Explainer

This lab provides hands-on practice integrating PromptForge with external APIs. By connecting APIs like weather, dictionary, or financial data services, learners can enrich model outputs with real-world, up-to-date information.

Through this exercise, students experience how PromptForge acts as a hub that not only upgrades prompts but also orchestrates data retrieval for more reliable and actionable outputs.

---

## Examples — Copy & Run

```text
# Example 1: Weather API
Connect to a weather API and provide tomorrow’s forecast in JSON format.

# Example 2: Dictionary API
Use a dictionary API to define "artificial intelligence" and return the definition in Markdown.

# Example 3: Finance API
Retrieve today’s stock price for Tesla and output it in a structured table.
```

## Lab — Guided Practice

**Objective:** Learn to connect PromptForge with APIs for enriched outputs.

1. Open **OraclePlayground** with preset `lab-5-connect-apis`.
2. Run the weather API example.
3. Replace the API call with a dictionary or finance API.
4. Observe how real-world data is integrated into the model’s output.

**Completion Criteria:** Learner successfully retrieves external data and integrates it into a structured, usable format.

---

## Mini-Quest — Applied Challenge

**Task:** Connect to a public API of your choice (e.g., news, currency exchange, or sports scores) and use PromptForge to generate a structured, shareable summary of the retrieved data.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Prompt connects to a valid external API.
- Output is accurate, structured, and clearly grounded in retrieved data.
- Summary is concise and ready for practical use.

## Quiz — Knowledge Check

1. **True / False:** PromptForge can integrate with external APIs to enhance prompt outputs. → **True**
2. **MCQ:** What is the key purpose of connecting APIs with PromptForge? → “To augment outputs with real-world data.”
