## Explainer

Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting encourages a model to explain its reasoning process before producing a final answer. By prompting the model to "think step by step," users can guide it to generate intermediate reasoning steps, which significantly improves performance on tasks requiring logical or multi-step thinking.

The strength of CoT lies in decomposing complex problems into smaller, manageable steps. This makes outputs more interpretable and reliable, especially in arithmetic, reasoning puzzles, and multi-part instructions.

## Examples — Copy & Run

```text
# Example 1: Math reasoning
What is 17 multiplied by 12? Let's think step by step.

# Example 2: Word problem
A store sells pencils at 3 for $1. How many pencils can I buy with $5? Let's solve step by step.

# Example 3: Logic puzzle
There are 5 red balls and 3 blue balls in a bag. If I remove 2 balls at random, what is the probability both are red? Let's solve step by step.
```

## Lab — Guided Practice

**Objective:** Apply CoT prompting to encourage structured reasoning.

1. Open **OraclePlayground** with preset `lab-2-cot`.
2. Run the train travel example.
3. Observe how the model explains each step of the calculation.
4. Modify the task to another word problem and repeat.
5. Compare results with and without the phrase “step by step.”

**Completion Criteria:** Model outputs include intermediate reasoning steps leading to a correct final answer.

## Mini-Quest — Applied Challenge

**Task:** Design a CoT prompt that solves the following: “A recipe requires 3 eggs for 12 muffins. How many eggs are needed for 30 muffins?”

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Model provides step-by-step reasoning.
- Final answer is mathematically correct.
- Reasoning process is clear and easy to follow.
