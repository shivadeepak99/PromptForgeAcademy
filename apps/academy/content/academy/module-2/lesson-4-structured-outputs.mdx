## Explainer

Structured output prompting guides the model to produce responses in a specific format, such as JSON, Markdown tables, or bullet lists. This technique is essential when the output needs to be machine-readable, integrated into applications, or systematically analyzed.

The benefit of structured prompting is consistency — instead of unpredictable free text, the model returns outputs that can be reliably parsed. However, the quality of the structure depends heavily on the clarity of the instructions provided.

## Examples — Copy & Run

```text
# Example 1: JSON output
Extract the following information and return it in JSON format: Name, Age, Occupation.
Text: Sarah, a 29-year-old data scientist, works at a startup.

# Example 2: Markdown table
Generate a Markdown table with two columns: Country and Capital. Include France, Japan, and Brazil.

# Example 3: Bulleted list
Provide a bulleted list of three common challenges in project management.
```

## Lab — Guided Practice

**Objective:** Practice creating prompts that enforce structured responses.

1. Open **OraclePlayground** with preset `lab-2-structured`.
2. Run the JSON extraction example.
3. Test additional instructions (e.g., Markdown table, CSV output).
4. Verify whether the model adheres strictly to the required structure.

**Completion Criteria:** The model outputs content in the specified structured format without deviation.

## Mini-Quest — Applied Challenge

**Task:** Write a prompt that outputs details of three books (Title, Author, Year) in JSON format.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Output is valid JSON.
- Includes exactly three books.
- Each book entry contains the required fields.

## Quiz — Knowledge Check

1. **True / False:** Structured output prompting helps ensure consistent response formatting. → **True**
2. **MCQ:** Which of the following is an example of a structured output format? → “A JSON object with keys and values.”
