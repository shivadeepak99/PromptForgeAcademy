## Explainer

Role prompting is a technique where you assign a specific role, identity, or perspective to the model to frame its responses. This strategy helps align outputs with a particular tone, expertise, or format. For instance, asking the model to act as a “physicist,” “travel guide,” or “legal advisor” influences how it structures its answers.

This approach is especially valuable for tasks that require domain-specific expertise or a particular style of communication. However, it must be applied carefully — mismatched personas (e.g., asking a “pirate” persona to write a formal contract) can create incoherent or unhelpful results.

## Examples — Copy & Run

```text
# Example 1: Code review role
You are a strict code reviewer. For the following JavaScript function, identify bugs and suggest one-line fixes.
Function: function add(a, b) { return a - b; }

# Example 2: Historian role
You are a historian. Explain the causes of World War I in three bullet points.

# Example 3: Teacher role
You are a math teacher. Solve the following equation and explain the steps:
2x + 5 = 15
```

## Lab — Guided Practice

**Objective:** Observe how role prompting shapes the model’s tone and structure.

1. Open **OraclePlayground** with preset `lab-2-role`.
2. Run the code reviewer example.
3. Modify the role (e.g., “supportive mentor” or “security expert”) and test how the response changes.
4. Compare outputs to see how persona framing affects clarity and detail.

**Completion Criteria:** Demonstrate that the role meaningfully changes the model’s style and focus.

## Mini-Quest — Applied Challenge

**Task:** Create a role prompt where the model acts as a *career coach* advising a university student on preparing for a job interview in data science.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The model adopts a supportive, advisory tone.
- Response includes at least 3 practical tips.
- Output is structured for easy readability (e.g., numbered list).

## Quiz — Knowledge Check

1. **True / False:** Role prompting assigns a persona to the LLM to influence its responses. → **True**
2. **MCQ:** Which of the following is an example of role prompting? → “You are a historian, explain the causes of World War I.”
