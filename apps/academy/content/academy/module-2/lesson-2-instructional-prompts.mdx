## Explainer

Instructional prompts explicitly direct the model to perform a task by framing the request as a set of instructions. These prompts provide clarity and structure, which is particularly effective for procedural, step-by-step, or ordered tasks.

Compared to zero-shot or role prompting, instructional prompts reduce ambiguity by giving the model clear guidance. They are useful for tutorials, process explanations, and structured outputs where order and precision matter.
