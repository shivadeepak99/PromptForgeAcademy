## Explainer

Vote-K prompting is an advanced strategy where the model generates multiple reasoning paths or outputs and then uses majority voting to decide on the most reliable final answer. Instead of relying on one solution, Vote-K leverages consensus across several runs.

This technique enhances consistency and reduces the chance of errors caused by outlier reasoning chains. It is particularly useful in reasoning tasks, translation, or classification, where multiple plausible outputs exist but agreement strengthens confidence in the result.

## Examples — Copy & Run

```text
# Example 1: Arithmetic with majority vote
What is 15 + 27? Generate 3 reasoning paths and vote on the final answer.

# Example 2: Translation with consensus
Translate "good morning" into French. Generate 5 outputs and select the most consistent one.

# Example 3: Riddle
If two hens lay two eggs in two days, how many eggs do six hens lay in six days? Generate 5 reasoning paths and vote for the answer.
```

## Lab — Guided Practice

**Objective:** Apply Vote-K prompting to strengthen reliability through consensus.

1. Open **OraclePlayground** with preset `lab-4-vote-k`.
2. Run the hens and eggs riddle with 5 reasoning paths.
3. Review each reasoning path and observe the majority decision.
4. Modify the task (e.g., arithmetic or translation) and repeat.
5. Compare single-path vs. majority-voted answers.

**Completion Criteria:** Model outputs a majority-voted final answer that is more reliable than a single output.

## Mini-Quest — Applied Challenge

**Task:** Design a Vote-K prompt to answer: “What is the capital of Australia?” Ensure the model generates 5 outputs and then votes on the correct final answer.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Model generates multiple candidate outputs.
- Majority voting determines the final answer.
- Output is consistent and accurate.

## Quiz — Knowledge Check

1. **True / False:** Vote-K prompting uses multiple outputs and majority voting to improve reliability. → **True**
2. **MCQ:** What is the main benefit of Vote-K prompting? → “It improves reliability through consensus.”
