## Explainer

Advanced Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting goes beyond the basic “step by step” instruction by incorporating techniques like **confidence scoring, multiple reasoning paths, and self-checking mechanisms**. These approaches improve reliability and robustness when solving multi-step or complex reasoning tasks.

By generating reasoning chains with confidence scores or comparing multiple reasoning paths, models can reduce errors and provide more trustworthy outputs. This is especially useful for mathematics, logical puzzles, and decision-making tasks.

## Examples — Copy & Run

```text
# Example 1: Confidence scoring
If there are 12 pencils and I give away 5, how many are left? Explain step by step and provide confidence levels for each step.

# Example 2: Profit calculation
A shopkeeper buys 3 pens at $2 each and sells them for $10 total. What is the profit? Solve step by step.

# Example 3: Logic puzzle
A farmer has 17 cows. All but 8 run away. How many cows remain? Think step by step and explain the reasoning.
```

## Lab — Guided Practice

**Objective:** Apply advanced CoT prompting with confidence scoring and multiple reasoning paths.

1. Open **OraclePlayground** with preset `lab-4-cot-advanced`.
2. Run the farmer puzzle example.
3. Review the reasoning chain and confidence scores.
4. Modify the problem to introduce ambiguity (e.g., word problems with multiple interpretations).
5. Compare results with and without confidence scoring.

**Completion Criteria:** Model produces step-by-step reasoning with added confidence or verification signals.

## Mini-Quest — Applied Challenge

**Task:** Create a CoT prompt that solves: “A train leaves at 2 PM and travels at 60 km/h. Another train leaves the same station at 3 PM traveling at 90 km/h. At what time will the second train catch up?”

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Output includes step-by-step reasoning.
- Model clearly explains time-distance calculation.
- Reasoning includes confidence or verification check.
