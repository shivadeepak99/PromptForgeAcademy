## Explainer

Meta-prompting is the practice of writing prompts that help generate or refine other prompts. Instead of crafting a single-use instruction, meta-prompts provide guidance for creating more effective prompts across different contexts.

For example, a meta-prompt might instruct the model to *improve clarity*, *enforce structure*, or *adapt tone* in a given prompt. This enables systematic refinement and reduces trial-and-error for users.

## Examples — Copy & Run

```text
# Example 1: Summarization improvement
Rewrite this prompt to make it more effective for summarization tasks:
"Explain the French Revolution in one paragraph."

# Example 2: Startup plan
Rewrite this prompt to improve clarity:
"Generate a detailed plan for a startup."

# Example 3: Energy list
Improve this intent:
"List advantages of renewable energy."
```

## Lab — Guided Practice

**Objective:** Practice writing and applying meta-prompts to refine instructions.

1. Open **OraclePlayground** with preset `lab-6-meta`.
2. Run the French Revolution example.
3. Observe how the prompt is rewritten for clarity.
4. Test additional prompts of your own (e.g., essay, classification, analysis).

**Completion Criteria:** The refined prompts are shorter, clearer, or more structured compared to the original.

## Mini-Quest — Applied Challenge

**Task:** Write a meta-prompt that rewrites: “Describe the impact of AI on education” into a more precise prompt requiring 3 bullet points and one real-world example.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Output includes a rewritten version of the original prompt.
- Rewritten prompt enforces bullet points and an example.
- Learner can run the improved prompt to verify results.
