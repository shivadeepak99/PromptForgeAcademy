## Explainer

PromptFile sequences are structured workflows where multiple prompts are chained together to perform multi-step tasks. Instead of relying on a single complex prompt, tasks are broken into modular steps that build on one another.

In SaaS applications, PromptFile sequences enable automation of processes like customer support analysis, bug triaging, and report generation. They enhance reliability, reusability, and scalability for enterprise use cases.

## Examples — Copy & Run

```text
# Example 1: Reviews analysis
PromptFile: Step 1 — Extract entities from reviews; Step 2 — Summarize results in JSON.

# Example 2: Bug reports
PromptFile: Step 1 — Analyze bug reports; Step 2 — Generate prioritized task list.

# Example 3: Feedback themes
Create a PromptFile sequence that first extracts customer feedback themes, then generates a summary report.
```

## Lab — Guided Practice

**Objective:** Learn to design and run PromptFile sequences for SaaS workflows.

1. Open **OraclePlayground** with preset `lab-6-promptfile`.
2. Run the customer feedback example.
3. Observe how multiple steps are chained into a coherent workflow.
4. Modify with your own SaaS workflow (e.g., onboarding emails, churn prediction).

**Completion Criteria:** Model executes a PromptFile sequence with at least two steps and produces structured outputs.

## Mini-Quest — Applied Challenge

**Task:** Build a PromptFile sequence for HR automation: Step 1 — Parse resumes to extract skills; Step 2 — Match skills to job requirements; Step 3 — Output a shortlist in JSON format.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Workflow has at least 3 sequential steps.
- Outputs are structured and actionable.
- Learner can explain how each step contributes to the final result.
