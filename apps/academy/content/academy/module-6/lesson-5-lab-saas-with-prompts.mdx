<LessonHeader title="Lab: Building SaaS with Prompts Only" xp={160} duration={40} belt="Red" />

## Explainer

This lab demonstrates how to prototype SaaS applications using only prompt chaining and structured workflows, without writing backend code. By chaining prompts strategically, learners can simulate end-to-end systems for domains like HR automation, finance, or customer support.

The key benefit is rapid prototyping — teams can validate workflows, test user experiences, and refine logic before investing in full-stack development.

## Lab — Guided Practice

**Objective:** Build a simple SaaS prototype using only prompts.

1. Open **OraclePlayground** with preset `lab-6-saas`.
2. Run the expense tracker workflow.
3. Replace it with another SaaS use case of your choice.
4. Observe how chained prompts create structured, sequential outputs.

**Completion Criteria:** Learner demonstrates a functional SaaS prototype entirely from prompt chaining.

## Mini-Quest — Applied Challenge

**Task:** Design a SaaS workflow for project management automation: Step 1 — Parse task descriptions; Step 2 — Assign owners based on skills; Step 3 — Output weekly progress summary.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Workflow has at least 3 sequential steps.
- Output is structured and actionable.
- Learner explains how the prototype could evolve into a full SaaS product.
