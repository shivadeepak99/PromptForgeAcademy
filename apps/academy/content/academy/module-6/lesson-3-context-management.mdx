## Explainer

Context management is the practice of handling long inputs within the token limits of language models. Since models cannot process unlimited text, prompts must be carefully structured, truncated, or summarized to preserve relevance.

Key strategies include:
- **Summarization**: Condense large inputs while retaining essential details.
- **Truncation**: Cut less relevant portions of text to fit within context limits.
- **Chunking**: Break long documents into smaller, sequential parts.

Effective context management ensures the model produces coherent and accurate outputs without exceeding token constraints.

## Examples — Copy & Run

```text
# Example 1: Summarization
Summarize this 2,000-word essay in less than 200 words, preserving key insights.

# Example 2: Debate transcript
Extract only the top 3 arguments from this debate transcript while staying under 300 tokens.

# Example 3: Truncated article
Manage context to summarize the following text within a 500-token limit.
Text: "Artificial Intelligence is rapidly evolving with applications across healthcare, finance, and education..."
```

## Lab — Guided Practice

**Objective:** Practice handling long inputs within model token limits.

1. Open **OraclePlayground** with preset `lab-6-context`.
2. Run the AI applications example.
3. Observe how the model balances detail with brevity.
4. Test with your own long text input.
5. Compare outputs at different token constraints.

**Completion Criteria:** Model produces coherent summaries or truncations that respect token limits.

## Mini-Quest — Applied Challenge

**Task:** Use context management to condense a long Wikipedia article (choose any topic) into exactly 5 bullet points under 300 tokens.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Output fits within the token budget.
- Only the most relevant details are preserved.
- Structure is clear and easy to read.

## Quiz — Knowledge Check

1. **True / False:** Context management ensures prompts remain effective within token limits. → **True**
2. **MCQ:** Which strategy helps manage long inputs effectively? → “Using truncation and summarization.”
