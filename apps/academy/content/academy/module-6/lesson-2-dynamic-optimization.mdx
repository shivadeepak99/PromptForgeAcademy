## Explainer

Dynamic prompt optimization involves iteratively improving prompts based on feedback, performance, or context. Instead of manually adjusting a prompt once, dynamic optimization treats prompt engineering as an ongoing process that adapts to results.

This technique can be automated with reinforcement learning, feedback loops, or heuristic adjustments, making prompts more efficient and robust for long-term use.

## Examples — Copy & Run

```text
# Example 1: Climate change summary
Optimize this prompt dynamically for better performance:
"Summarize the article about climate change in 5 bullet points."

# Example 2: Blockchain explanation
Dynamically optimize:
"Explain blockchain technology to a beginner in 3 sentences."

# Example 3: Python script
Improve efficiency:
"Write a Python script to calculate Fibonacci numbers."
```

## Lab — Guided Practice

**Objective:** Learn to iteratively refine prompts for improved outcomes.

1. Open **OraclePlayground** with preset `lab-6-dynamic`.
2. Run the climate change summary example.
3. Observe differences between initial and optimized versions.
4. Repeat the process with your own prompts.
5. Compare clarity, length, and relevance between iterations.

**Completion Criteria:** Learner demonstrates improved prompt outputs through at least one optimization cycle.

## Mini-Quest — Applied Challenge

**Task:** Create a dynamic optimization cycle for this prompt: “Summarize the benefits and risks of AI in healthcare.” Improve the prompt until the output is concise, balanced, and professional.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- At least two iterations of refinement are shown.
- Final output balances both benefits and risks.
- Learner explains how optimization improved the result.
