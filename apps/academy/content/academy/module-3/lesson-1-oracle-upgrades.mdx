## Explainer

The Oracle is a key feature in PromptForge that enhances user-provided intents by upgrading them into structured, effective prompts. Instead of relying solely on manual experimentation, learners can use the Oracle to generate refined prompts that improve clarity, enforce formatting, and optimize results.

This module introduces hands-on labs with the Oracle so learners can practice refining prompts in real-world workflows. It ensures that students understand not only how to write prompts but also how to systematically improve them using built-in tools.

## Examples — Copy & Run

```text
# Example 1: Refinement
Refine this intent so it outputs a structured JSON:
"Summarize Ada Lovelace’s contributions."

# Example 2: Clarity upgrade
Upgrade this prompt:
"Explain machine learning basics."

# Example 3: Professional format
Upgrade the intent:
"Write a professional email asking for a project update."
```

## Lab — Guided Practice

**Objective:** Learn to refine raw intents into precise prompts using the Oracle.

1. Open **OraclePlayground** with preset `lab-3-oracle`.
2. Input the Ada Lovelace example.
3. Observe how the Oracle restructures the prompt for clarity and format.
4. Run the refined prompt and review the output.
5. Repeat with your own casual intent and compare Oracle’s upgraded version.

**Completion Criteria:** Demonstrate two successful upgrades that improve structure and readability.

## Mini-Quest — Applied Challenge

**Task:** Write an informal intent asking for a bulleted list of cybersecurity risks. Use the Oracle to upgrade it into a professional, structured prompt. Run both and compare the outputs.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Oracle version enforces structured format.
- Output is consistent and actionable.
- Learner can clearly explain the improvement.
