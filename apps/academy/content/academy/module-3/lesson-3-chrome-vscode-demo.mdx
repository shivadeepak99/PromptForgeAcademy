## Explainer

PromptForge provides lightweight extensions for Chrome and VS Code that integrate the Oracle’s upgrade capabilities directly into the user’s workflow. Instead of switching between applications, learners can refine prompts inside the environments where they read, write, or code.

- **Chrome Extension**: Enables quick upgrades while browsing articles, research papers, or any online content.
- **VS Code Extension**: Brings Oracle functionality into the development environment, useful for refining prompts related to documentation, code review, or test generation.

These integrations make prompt refinement seamless, reducing friction and encouraging hands-on experimentation.

## Examples — Copy & Run

```text
# Example 1: Chrome extension usage
Highlight a paragraph on a news website and run the Oracle upgrade to generate a concise summary prompt.

# Example 2: VS Code extension usage
Highlight a Python function and use the extension to upgrade the intent: "Generate documentation for this function."

# Example 3: Workflow integration
Upgrade prompts in-line within your workspace to streamline research or development tasks.
```

## Lab — Guided Practice

**Objective:** Learn how to use PromptForge extensions within real workflows.

1. Install the Chrome or VS Code extension.
2. Highlight text (article content or code snippet).
3. Use the Oracle upgrade option to refine the prompt.
4. Run the refined prompt and observe the results.

**Completion Criteria:** Learner demonstrates a successful run using either the Chrome or VS Code extension, producing a refined and actionable prompt.

## Mini-Quest — Applied Challenge

**Task:** Use either extension to upgrade an informal intent into a structured prompt. Submit the upgraded prompt and its output.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Prompt is clearly improved in structure and clarity.
- Output demonstrates direct integration within Chrome or VS Code.
- Submission shows understanding of extension workflows.
