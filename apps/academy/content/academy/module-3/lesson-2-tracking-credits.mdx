## Explainer

PromptForge uses a **credit system** to manage platform usage and encourage efficient prompt design. Credits are consumed whenever learners run prompts, labs, or quests. Analytics provide feedback on performance, helping users refine their approach while keeping track of resource consumption.

Credits and analytics are essential for maintaining a sustainable learning flow. By monitoring usage, learners can balance experimentation with strategic practice and identify areas for improvement.

## Examples — Copy & Run

```text
# Example 1: Credit check
How many credits have I used this week?

# Example 2: Usage summary
Show me a breakdown of my token usage for the last 5 runs.

# Example 3: Performance insights
Summarize the success rate of my last 10 prompt executions.
```

## Lab — Guided Practice

**Objective:** Learn how to track and interpret credit usage and analytics.

1. Open **OraclePlayground** with preset `lab-3-credits`.
2. Run a few upgraded prompts to consume credits.
3. Use the analytics interface to check token usage and success rates.
4. Compare results across different prompts.

**Completion Criteria:** Learner demonstrates the ability to view credits consumed and interpret at least one analytic metric (e.g., token usage or success rate).

---

## Mini-Quest — Applied Challenge

**Task:** Run three different prompts and record your credit usage. Submit a short reflection on which prompt was the most efficient (in terms of tokens vs. clarity of output).

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Credit usage is documented for all three prompts.
- Reflection explains the observed efficiency.
- Submission shows awareness of balancing credit usage with output quality.

## Quiz — Knowledge Check

1. **True / False:** PromptForge credits are deducted when you run prompts, labs, or quests. → **True**
2. **MCQ:** Which of the following is NOT tracked in PromptForge analytics? → “User sleep schedule.”
