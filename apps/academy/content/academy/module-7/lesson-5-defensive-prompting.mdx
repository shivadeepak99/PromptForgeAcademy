## Explainer

Defensive prompting refers to designing prompts in ways that minimize the risk of harmful, biased, or insecure outputs. By proactively structuring prompts, sensitive data leakage, jailbreaks, or misinterpretations can be reduced.

Key strategies include:
- **Input filtering**: Exclude or mask sensitive details.
- **Explicit rules**: State what *not* to output (e.g., “Do not reveal passwords”).
- **Role reinforcement**: Emphasize secure, limited roles for the model.

Defensive prompting forms the first line of protection against prompt injection, jailbreaks, and exfiltration.

## Examples — Copy & Run

```text
# Example 1: Secure summarization
Securely summarize this customer support request without exposing sensitive account details.

# Example 2: Data filtering
Rewrite this prompt to filter out personal data before generating a response.

# Example 3: Safe report
Summarize this document but exclude passwords, tokens, or financial details.
```

## Lab — Guided Practice

**Objective:** Apply defensive prompting to mitigate risks.

1. Open **OraclePlayground** with preset `lab-7-defense`.
2. Run the secure summarization example.
3. Observe how the model avoids exposing sensitive details.
4. Modify prompts to strengthen defenses further.

**Completion Criteria:** Learner demonstrates a secure output that excludes or masks sensitive information.

## Mini-Quest — Applied Challenge

**Task:** Design a defensive prompt for an HR assistant that processes resumes but must not reveal addresses or phone numbers. Test it in the sandbox and confirm compliance.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Prompt explicitly prevents leakage of sensitive fields.
- Output complies with rules.
- Learner explains why the defense works.
